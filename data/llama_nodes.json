CHAPTER I.\n\n## LOOMINGS\n\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago\u2014never mind how long precisely\u2014having little\nor no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought\nI would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have\nof driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself\ngrowing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my\nsoul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos\nget such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent\nme from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\u2019s\nhats off\u2014then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. \ue053is is my\nsubstitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself\nupon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. \ue053ere is nothing surprising in this. If\nthey but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very\nnearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\ue053ere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as\nIndian isles by coral reefs\u2014commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left,\nthe streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that\nnoble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous\nwere out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you\nsee?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some\nseated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;\nsome high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But\nthese are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster\u2014tied to counters,\nnailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this?

Why\nis almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time\nor other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you\nyourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were\nnow out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not\nwithout meaning.

I abandon the glory and distin\ue076ion of such offices to those\nwho like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respe\ue076able toils, trials,\nand tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take\ncare of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what\nnot. And as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory in\nthat, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I never fancied\nbroiling fowls; \u2014though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically\nsalted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respe\ue076fully, not to say\nreverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the\nold Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies\nof those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb\ndown into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather\norder me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in\na May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches\none\u2019s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the\nland, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a\ncountry schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. \ue053e transition\nis a keen one, I assure you, from the schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong\ndeco\ue076ion of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this\nwears off in time.\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and\nsweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean,\nin the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks\nanything the less of me, because I promptly and respe\ue076fully obey that old hunks\nin that particular instance? Who aint a slave?

On one side hung a very large oil-painting so thoroughly\nbesmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal cross-lights by which you\nviewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and\ncareful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding\nof its purpose. such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first you\nalmost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New England hags,\nhad endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest\ncontemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by throwing open the\nlittle window towards the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclusion\nthat such an idea, however wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,\nblack mass of something hovering in the centre of the pi\ue076ure over three blue,\ndim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.

Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the\nshelf over the fire- place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light,\nand felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfa\ue076ory\nconclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine\nquills round an Indian moccasin. \ue053ere was a hole or slit in the middle of this\nmat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of\nany Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me\ndown like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little\ndamp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I\nwent up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight\nin my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the\nneck.\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this headpeddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-side,\nI got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room\nthinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.\nBut beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering\nwhat the landlord said about the harpooneer\u2019s not coming home at all that night,\nit being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and\nboots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\nto the care of heaven.\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is\nno telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At\nlast I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards\nthe land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer\nof light come into the room from under the door.\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.\nBut I lay perfe\ue076ly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a\nlight in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other, the stranger\nentered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good\nway off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the\nknotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room.

To be\nsure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of\na hot sun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never\nbeen in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary\neffe\ue076s upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like\nlightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having\nopened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of\ntomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest\nin the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head\u2014a ghastly thing\nenough\u2014and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat\u2014a new\nbeaver hat\u2014when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. \ue053ere was no hair\non his head\u2014none to speak of at least\u2014nothing but a small scalp- knot twisted\nup on his forehead.

I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling\npurple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear,\nand being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, i confess i\nwas now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\ninto my room at the dead of night. In fa\ue076, I was so afraid of him that I was not\ngame enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfa\ue076ory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him. Meanwhile, he continued the business of\nundressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts\nof him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a \ue053irty Years\u2019 War, and\njust escaped from it with a sticking- plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were\nmarked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young\npalms.

He might take a fancy to mine\u2014heavens! look at that tomahawk!\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must\nindeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which\nhe had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at\nlength a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exa\ue076ly the\ncolor of a three days\u2019 old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first\nI almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good\ndeal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol,\nwhich indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace,\nand removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunchbacked image, like\na tenpin, between the andirons. the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were\nvery sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or\nchapel for his Congo idol.\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at\nease meantime\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double\nhandful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the\nidol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp,\nhe kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches\ninto the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to\nbe scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then\nblowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little\nnegro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\nnever moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger\nguttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else\nsinging some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\nthe most unnatural manner.

You had almost thought I had been\nhis wife. \ue053e counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares\nand triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\nlabyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade\u2014owing I\nsuppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times\u2014this same arm of his, I say, looked\nfor all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on\nit as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so\nblended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure\nthat I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child,\nI well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was\na reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. \ue053e circumstance was this. I\nhad been cutting up some caper or other\u2014I think it was trying to crawl up the\nchimney, as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother\nwho, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\nsupperless,\u2014my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed\nme off to bed, though it was only two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the \uf645\uf644st June, the\nlongest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help\nfor it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as\nslowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I\ncould hope for a resurre\ue076ion.

But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and\nback I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling\na great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent\nmisfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\nslowly waking from it\u2014half steeped in dreams\u2014I opened my eyes, and the before\nsun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running\nthrough all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but\na supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,\nand the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, sseated by my bedside. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I\nknew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the\nmorning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months\nafterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.

For though I tried to move his\narm\u2014unlock his bridegroom clasp\u2014yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me\ntightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.

As it is, parts of her back\ncountry are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. \ue053e town itself is perhaps\nthe dearest place to live in, in all New England.

Yet, in spite of\nthis, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and\ngardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted\nupon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery\ngardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they\nwere harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr\nAlexander perform a feat like that?\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters,\nand portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a- piece.

And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of\ncongregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in many a distri\ue076of New\nBedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks\nthrown aside at creation\u2019s final day.\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.

Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by\nthe whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a sailor\nand a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life\nto the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\nwinter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second\nflowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain\nmild gleams of a newly developing bloom\u2014the spring verdure peeping forth even\nbeneath February\u2019s snow. No one having previously heard his history, could for the\nfirst time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous\nmaritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\nand certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with\nmelting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the\nfloor with the weight of the water it had absorbed.

Halting for an instant at the foot of the\nladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes,\nFather Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top\nof his vessel.\n\ue053e perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging\nones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that at every\nstep there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me\nthat however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed\nunnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\nslowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his\nlittle Quebec.\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father\nMapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and san\ue076ity, that I could not\nsuspe\ue076him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No, thought\nI, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that a\ue076of physical isolation, he\nsignifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and\nconnexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the\nfaithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self- containing stronghold\u2014a lofty\nEhrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed\nfrom the chaplain\u2019s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either\nhand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of\nblack rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\nclouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel\u2019s\nface; and this bright face shed a distin\ue076spot of radiance upon the ship\u2019s tossed\ndeck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the Vi\ue076ory\u2019s plank where\nNelson fell. \u201dAh, noble ship,\u201c the angel seemed to say, \u201dbeat on, beat on, thou\nnoble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds\nare rolling off\u2014serenest azure is at hand\u201c.\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved\nthe ladder and the pi\ue076ure. Its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship\u2019s bluff\nbows, and the Holy Bible rested on the proje\ue076ing piece of scroll work, fashioned\nafter a ship\u2019s fiddle-headed beak.\nWhat could be more full of meaning?\u2014for the pulpit is ever this earth\u2019s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world.

all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling\nof the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of\nthe Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: \u201cBeloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah\u2014\u201cAnd God had\nprepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.\u201d\n\u201cShipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\u2014four yarns\u2014is one of\nthe smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of\nthe soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this\nprophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish\u2019s belly! How billow- like\nand boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him\nto the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about\nus! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a twostranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of\nthe living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the\nsin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance,\nprayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among\nmen, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command\nof God\u2014never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed\u2014which he\nfound a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for\nus to do\u2014remember that\u2014and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors\nto persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this\ndisobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.\nWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by\nseeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him into\ncountries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks\nabout the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that\u2019s bound for Tarshish. \ue053ere lurks,\nperhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have\nbeen no other city than the modern Cadiz. \ue053at\u2019s the opinion of learned men.\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa,\nas Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was\nan almost unknown sea.

But\nobserve his prayer, and so many white bolts, upon his prison. \ue053en Jonah prayed\nunto learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for\ndire\ue076deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his\ndeliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and\npangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true\nand faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.\nAnd how pleasing to God was this condu\ue076in Jonah, is shown in the eventual\ndeliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for\nrepentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.\u201d\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting\nstorm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing\nJonah\u2019s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as\nwith a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and\nthe thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping\nfrom his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was\nstrange to them.\n\ue053ere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of\nthe Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the\nmoment, seemed communing with God and himself.\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with\nan aspe\ue076of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words: \u201cShipmates,\nGod has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I have\nread ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all\nsinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner than\nye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on\nthe hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you\nreads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me as a pilot of\nthe living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things,\nand bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked\nNineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,\nand sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is\neverywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him\nin the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift\nslantings tore him along \u201cinto the midst of the seas,\u201c where the eddying depths\nsucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and\u201d the weeds were wrapped about his\nhead,\u201c and all the watery world of woe bowled over him.

He would then begin again at the next fifty;\nseeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count\nmore than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found\ntogether, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\nWith much interest I sat watching him.

You cannot hide the soul. \ue053rough all\nhis unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and\nin his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that\nwould dare a thousand devils.

It\nis not down in any map; true places never are.\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\ngrass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even\nthen, in Queequeg\u2019s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see something more\nof Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief, a\nKing; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were\nthe wives of unconquerable warriors. \ue053ere was excellent blood in his veins\u2014royal\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his\nuntutored youth.\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\u2019s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to\nChristian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his\nsuit; and not all the King his father\u2019s influence could prevail. But Queequeg vowed\na vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the\nship must pass through when she quitted the island.

But,\nalas! the pra\ue076ices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could\nbe both miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father\u2019s heathens.\nArrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then\ngoing on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,\npoor Queequeg gave it up for lost. \ue053ought he, it\u2019s a wicked world in all meridians;\nI\u2019ll die a pagan.\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore\ntheir clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.

He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him\nthat whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out\nof Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to\nembark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard\nthe same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me,\nin short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the\nPotluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affe\ue076ion\nI now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could\nnot fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the\nmysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant\nseamen.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2606, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "6db682ea-8222-43ed-9592-f5ad7af9d386", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 53, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb91601d-6881-40a0-98db-29d078fd3442", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 53, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "eadad024a983efb7067121013462ffa870e90c36b091e62a1790371200f88acb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "480525d0-aebb-4ecd-ba9b-f9a7a59eae36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 53, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "3c212f963098b315c95e8c7d5c38331a7fe6ba8e736b860ff9a8826c51dc0184", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "His story being ended with his pipe\u2019s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me,\npressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from\neach other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.\n\n\uf647\uf649\n\n\n-----\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2606, "end_char_idx": 2838, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "53a67a9b-9022-41d6-ad65-4d0c99c50cae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 54, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ee6e759-ac5a-4592-8fab-d2463bdb5fc4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 54, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "c41f9a4353afa731446e4174bca3eec4338695e68379aade7e6e2b09d76129eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b96a690-d1d4-45bb-b77a-49bb438b2f09", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e26b651bd8712c189b63e379f532018da7d5b6e25d1dbed41e444204d308545c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "### CHAPTER XII.\n\n## WHEELBARROW\n\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a\nblock, I settled my own and comrade\u2019s bill; using, however, my comrade\u2019s money.\n\ue053e grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the\nsudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg\u2014 especially\nas Peter Coffin\u2019s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed\nme concerning the very person whom I now companied with.\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\u2019s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down\nto \u201cthe Moss,\u201d the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf.

So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a\nlubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed\nnegro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense\ngreenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg\ncaught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the\nbumpkin\u2019s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage\ncaught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent\nhim high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset,\nthe fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his\nback upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\n\u201cCapting!

Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\nthe world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the\nEddystone lighthouse. Look at it\u2014a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach,\nwithout a background. \ue053ere is more sand there than you would use in twenty\nyears as a substitute for blotting paper.

But these\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled\nby the red-men. \ue053us goes the legend.

After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I\nlearnt that there were three ships up for three-years\u2019 voyages\u2014\ue053e Devil-Dam the\nTit- bit, and the Pequod. Devil- dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is\nobvious; Pequod, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe\nof Massachusetts Indians, now extin\ue076as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed\nabout the Devil-Dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and, finally, going on\nboard the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this\nwas the very ship for us.\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;\u2014squaredtoed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but\ntake my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old\nPequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old\nfashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\ntyphoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull\u2019s complexion was darkened\nlike a French grenadier\u2019s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts\u2014cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,\nwhere her original ones were lost overboard in a gale\u2014her masts stood stiffly up\nlike the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and\nwrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where\nBeckett bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous\nfeatures, pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\nanother vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\nowners of the Pequod,\u2014this old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had\nbuilt upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness\nboth of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be \ue053orkill-Hake\u2019s\ncarved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies.\nA cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All\nround, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw,\nwith the long sharp teeth of the Sperm Whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten\nher old hempen thews and tendons to. \ue053ose thews ran not through base blocks\nof land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.

It seemed only a temporary ere\ue076ion used in port.\nIt was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs\nof limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\nright-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced\ntogether, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted\npoint, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like a top-knot on some old\nPottowotamie Sachem\u2019s head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the\nship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\nhis aspe\ue076seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship\u2019s work\nsuspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command.

People in Nantucket invest their money in\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing\nin good interest.\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker,\nthe island having been originally settled by that se\ue076; and to this day its inhabitants\nin general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only\nvariously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.\nFor some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters. \ue053ey are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2273, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "2e69dfff-5037-4b68-9d7e-7ef538d9aa94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 67, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eaae79c7-c48d-43fc-a88a-f82fd2b99bf2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 67, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "6d8055f582d90caa6fba5e3911d00155d2bca94a61ab21c7c099e2530eddde6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8099b10-428e-462f-b13d-83dc82ad855f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 67, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "c39daee0fce79de0912f5403cd1f132905d54b4bdc36d0f8e8e1f874c5263b7c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\nnames\u2014a singularly common fashion on the island\u2014and in childhood naturally\nimbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the\naudacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely\nblend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of chara\ue076er,\nnot unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.

But, as\nyet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man,\nwho, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker,\nmodified by individual circumstances.\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But\nunlike Captain Peleg\u2014who cared not a rush for what are called serious things,\nand indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all trifles\u2014Captain\nBildad had not only been originally educated according to the stri\ue076est se\ue076of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad,\nlovely island creatures, round the Horn\u2014all that had not moved this native born\nQuaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest. Still,\nfor all this immutableness, was there some lack of common consistency about\nworthy Captain Bildad. \ue053ough refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear\narms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and\nPacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straightbodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\nhe had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man\u2019s religion\nis one thing, and this pra\ue076ical world quite another. \ue053is world pays dividends.\nRising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate,\nand captain, and finally a ship-owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\nhis adventurous career by wholly retiring from a\ue076ive life at the goodly age of sixty,\nand dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\nNow Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible\nold hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. \ue053ey told me in\nNantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old\nCategut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore\nto the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for\na Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted to say the least.

Not only\nwere the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts of\ncanvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship\u2019s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but\nsat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the\npurchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on\nthe rigging were working till long after night-fall.\nOn the day following Queequeg\u2019s signing the articles, word was given at all\nthe inns where the ship\u2019s company were stopping, that their chests must be on\nboard before night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing.\nSo Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the\nlast. But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did\nnot sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and\nthere is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully\nequipped.\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things\u2014beds, sauce-pans, knives and\nforks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable\nto the business of housekeeping.

But, as before hinted, for some time there was a continual fetching\nand carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad\u2019s\nsister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but withal\nvery kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it, nothing should\nbe found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she\nwould come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward\u2019s pantry; another time\nwith a bunch of quills for the chief mate\u2019s desk, where he kept his log; a third time\nwith a roll of flannel for the small of some one\u2019s rheumatic back. Never did any\nwoman better deserve her name, which was Charity\u2014Aunt Charity, as everybody\ncalled her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about\nhither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to\nyield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved\nbrother Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of\nwell-saved dollars.\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board,\nas she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling\nlance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward.\nAs for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed, and\nat every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.\nEvery once and a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at\nthe men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then\nconcluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and\nas often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going\nto come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he was\ngetting better and better, and was expe\ue076ed aboard every day; meantime, the two\nCaptains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel\nfor the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen\nvery plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so\nlong a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute\ndi\ue076ator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man\nsuspe\ue076s any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the\nmatter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And\nmuch this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2989, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "3058209d-c3f2-4715-87e3-c454e0d6ab6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 81, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1c3f6cbd-be09-4a09-b1bd-979a67b48e2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 81, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "b46d426ebacba6d673fb4d39522d4a4ac2234bcb2f4254b47101cd8f14ced32c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "48c75b69-f8a7-47e9-9ad7-0498d717a315", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 81, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "af5f1da35ead94715a2893468ec4222422419500a947992b4d74acdc7b95dadb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\n\n\uf64a\uf647\n\n\n-----\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2989, "end_char_idx": 3059, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "e9db94b5-b73b-4c2b-b301-8d317aa8d788", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 82, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20ee3582-065a-43a4-8fa5-6e0b75e5c6ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 82, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "35bf9d4c1dd93df08baa4b7adbbcc1d0fd9b82cae25135a8ed8d9bffa05a175e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09d849df-3a13-41a0-9649-369b06b043fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c79bc74805128e13fa037ad8aab2a460748401ac7069f91d74286a610a7f7ae0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "### CHAPTER XIX.\n\n## GOING ABOARD\n\nIt was nearly six o\u2019clock, but only grey imperfe\ue076misty dawn, when we drew nigh\nthe wharf.\n\u201c\ue053ere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\u201d said I to Queequeg,\n\u201cit can\u2019t be shadows; she\u2019s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!\u201d\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us,\nlaid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us,\nstood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from\nQueequeg to me.

Blood and thunder!\u2014jump!\u201c\u2014was the next command,\nand the crew sprang for the handspikes.\nNow, in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is\nthe forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in\naddition to his other offices, was one of the licensed pilots of the port\u2014he being\nsuspe\ue076ed to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee\nto all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft\u2014Bildad, I\nsay, might now be seen a\ue076ively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to\ncheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the\ngirls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the\nPequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a\nsmall choice copy of Watts in each seaman\u2019s berth.\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and\nswore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink the\nship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike,\nand told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting\non the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however,\nwith the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his\nseven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my\nrear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the a\ue076\nof withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. \ue053at was my first kick.\n\u201dIs that the way they heave in the marchant service?\u201c he roared. \u201dSpring,\nthou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! why don\u2019t ye spring, i say, all\nof ye\u2014spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there,\nScotchcap; spring, thou green pants.

I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years\u2019 dangerous\nvoyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. \ue053e\nland seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave\nof Bulkington.

Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and butchers\nof the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of\nour business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain fa\ue076s hitherto pretty generally\nunknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.

His pure tight\nskin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner\nhealth and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to\nendure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or\ntorrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well\nin all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering\nimages of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A\nstaid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of a\ue076ion,\nand not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affe\ue076ed, and in some cases seemed\nwell nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman,\nand endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life\ndid therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition,\nwhich in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence\nthan from ignorance.

What doom was his own father\u2019s? Where, in the\nbottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could, nevertheless,\nstill flourish, must indeed have been extreme.

He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according\nto local usage, was called a Cape-Cod- man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven\nnor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while engaged\nin the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and colle\ue076ed as a\njourneyman joiner engaged for the year. Good- humored, easy, and careless, he\npresided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and\nhis crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement\nof his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box. When\nclose to the whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying\nlance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum\nover his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster.\nLong usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair.\nWhat he thought of death itself, there is no telling.

A short,\nstout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow\nseemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted\nhim; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to destroy them\nwhenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the\nmany marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything\nlike an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in his\npoor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time\nand trouble in order to kill and boil. \ue053is ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his\nmade him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun\nof it; and a three years\u2019 voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\nthat length of time.

Little Flask was one of the wrought\nones; made to clinch tight and last long. \ue053ey called him King-Post on board of\nthe Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber\nknown by that name in Ar\ue076ic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating\nside timbers inserted in it, served to brace the ship against the icy concussions of\nthose battering seas.\nNow these three mates\u2014Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\n\ue053ey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod\u2019s boats\nas headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably\nmarshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as captains\nof companies.

Yes, their\nsupreme lord and di\ue076ator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft\nto mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague disquietude touching the\nunknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation.\n\ue053is was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah\u2019s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before\nconceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of\nthe wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness\u2014to call it\nso\u2014which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed\nagainst all warrantry to cherish such emotions.

But it was especially the aspe\ue076of the\nthree chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to\nallay these colorless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every\npresentment of the voyage.

He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire\nhas overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away\none particle from their compa\ue076ed aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,\nseemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini\u2019s\ncast Perseus. \ue053reading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing\nright down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his\nclothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when\nthe upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig,\npeels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the soil,\nleaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with\nhim, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was\nmade to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego\u2019s senior, an old Gay-Head\nIndian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years\nold did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\nfury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed\ninferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral\nman, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye\nupon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities,\npopularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment.\nSo that no white sailor seriously contradi\ue076ed him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out\u2014which might hardly come to pass, so\nhe muttered\u2014then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a\nbirth-mark on him from crown to sole.\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspe\ue076of Ahab affe\ue076me, and the livid brand\nwhich streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little\nof this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he\npartly stood.

He has a quiver of \u2019em.\u201d\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the\nPequod\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizen shrouds, there was an auger\nhole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg steadied in\nthat hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood ere\ue076,\nlooking straight out beyond the ship\u2019s ever-pitching prow. \ue053ere was an infinity\nof firmest fortitude, a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his\nofficers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions,\nthey plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, consciousness of being under a\ntroubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before\nthem with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of\nsome mighty woe.\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after\nthat morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his pivothole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the deck. As the\nsky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and\nless a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead\nwintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.

Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground\nthat the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. \ue053is fundamental\nthing settled, the next point is, in what internal respe\ue076does the whale differ from\nother fish. Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these:\nlungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting\nfish with a horizontal tail. \ue053ere you have him. However contra\ue076ed, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale,\nbut the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. but the last term of the\ndefinition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must\nhave noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical,\nor up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be\nsimilarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the\nleviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the\nbest informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto\nauthoritatively regarded as alien. Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal\ntailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.

He is, without doubt,\nthe largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter;\nthe most majestic in aspe\ue076; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he\nbeing the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is\nchiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm Whale was almost wholly unknown\nin his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained\nfrom the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England\nas the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti\nwas that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the\nword literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,\nnot being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only\nto be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When,\nas I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its\noriginal name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last\nhave come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really\nderived.\nB\uf76f\uf76f\uf76bI.

But they precisely agree in all their grand\nfeatures; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fa\ue076upon which\nto ground a radical distin\ue076ion. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most\ninconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. \ue053e Right Whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length,\nwith reference to elucidating the Sperm Whale.\nB\uf76f\uf76f\uf76bI (F\uf76f\uf76c\uf769\uf76f), C\uf768\uf761\uf770\uf774\uf765\uf772III (F\uf769\uf76e-B\uf761\uf763\uf76b). \u2014Under this head I reckon a\nmonster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall- Spout, and Long-John,\nhas been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet\nis so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packettracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the Right\nWhale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His\ngreat lips present a cable-like aspe\ue076, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of\nlarge wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives\nhis name, is often a conspicuous obje\ue076. this fin is some three or four feet long,\ngrowing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with\na very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be\nvisible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly proje\ue076ing from the surface.\nWhen the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and\nthis gnomon- like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it\nmay well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a\ndial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow\noften goes back. \ue053e Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpe\ue076edly rising to the\nsurface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet\nrising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man;\nthis Leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing\nfor his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the Right Whale, among a theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so\ncalled Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which,\nhowever, are little known.

He is of moderate o\ue076avo size, varying from fifteen\nto twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.\nHe swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in\nquantity, and pretty good for light.

His voracity is\nwell known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved\nupwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. \ue053is whale\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which\nlooks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the\nSperm Whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena Whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment\u2014as some frugal housekeepers, in the\nabsence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead\nof odorous wax. \ue053ough their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield\nyou upwards of thirty gallons of oil.\nB\uf76f\uf76f\uf76bII (O\uf763\uf774\uf761\uf776\uf76f), C\uf768\uf761\uf770\uf774\uf765\uf772III (N\uf761\uf772\uf777\uf768\uf761\uf76c\uf765), \uf774\uf768\uf761\uf774\uf769\uf773, N\uf76f\uf773\uf774\uf772\uf769\uf76cW\uf768\uf761\uf76c\uf765.\n\u2014Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his\npeculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. \ue053e creature is some\nsixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten,\nand even attain to fifteen feet.

My\nown opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale\u2014however that may be\u2014it would certainly be very convenient to him for a\nfolder in reading pamphlets. \ue053e Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked Whale,\nthe Horned Whale, and the Unicorn Whale. He is certainly a curious example of\nthe Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From\ncertain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn\u2019s horn\nwas in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such,\npreparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts\nfor fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufa\ue076ured\ninto hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an obje\ue076of great curiosity.\nBlack Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,\nwhen Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of\nGreenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the \ue053ames; when Sir Martin returned from that voyage, saith Black Letter, on bended knees he presented to her\nhighness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after\nhung in the castle at Windsor. An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on\nbended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a\nland beast of the unicorn nature.\n\ue053e Narwhale has a very pi\ue076uresque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white\nground color, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very superior,\nclear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found\nin the circumpolar seas.\nB\uf76f\uf76f\uf76bII (O\uf763\uf774\uf761\uf776\uf76f), C\uf768\uf761\uf770\uf774\uf765\uf772IV (K\uf769\uf76c\uf76c\uf765\uf772). \u2014Of this whale little is precisely\nknown to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalist. From\nwhat I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness\nof a grampus. He is very savage\u2014a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the\ngreat Folio Whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is\nworried to death. \ue053e Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground\nof its indistin\ue076ness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and\nSharks included.\nB\uf76f\uf76f\uf76bII (O\uf763\uf774\uf761\uf776\uf76f), C\uf768\uf761\uf770\uf774\uf765\uf772V (T\uf768\uf772\uf761\uf773\uf768\uf765\uf772). \u2014\ue053is gentleman is famous\nfor his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.

Literally\nthis word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\nHarpooneer. In those days, the captain\u2019s authority was restri\ue076ed to the navigation\nand general management of the vessel: while over the whale-hunting department\nand all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In\nthe British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old\nDutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present\nhe ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\u2019s\nmore inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good condu\ue076of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American\nFishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship\u2019s deck is\nalso his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should\nnominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded\nas their social equal.\nNow, the grand distin\ue076ion drawn between officer and man at sea, is this\u2014the\nfirst lives aft, the last forward.

If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask,\nhappens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\nrepast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls\nthat day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. \ue053erefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the\ndignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\notherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much relieve his\nhunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfa\ue076ion, thought Flask, have\nfor ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fist\na bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the\nmast. \ue053ere\u2019s the fruits of promotion now; there\u2019s the vanity of glory: there\u2019s the\ninsanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a\ngrudge against Flask in Flask\u2019s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order\nto obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in\nthe Pequod\u2019s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their\narrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried order\nby the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast,\nthey being its residuary legatees. \ue053ey made a sort of temporary servants\u2019 hall of\nthe high and mighty cabin.\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible\ndomineerings of the captain\u2019s table, was the entire care-free license and ease, the\nalmost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers. While their\nmasters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the\nharpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. \ue053ey\ndined like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.\nSuch portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a\ngreat baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.

When\nCaptain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow\u2019s nest of his, he tells us\nthat he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder\nflask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray Narwhales, or vagrant sea\nunicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the\ndeck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very\ndifferent thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe,\nas he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow\u2019s-nest; but though he so\nenlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account\nof his experiments in this crow\u2019s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the\npurpose of countera\ue076ing the errors resulting from what is called the \u201clocal attraction\u201d of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the\niron in the ship\u2019s planks, and in the Glacier\u2019s case, perhaps, to there having been so\nmany broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain\nis very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned \u201cbinnacle deviations,\u201d\n\u201cazimuth compass observations,\u201c and \u201capproximate errors,\u201d he knows very well,\nCaptain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic\nmeditations, as to fail being attra\ue076ed occasionally towards that well replenished\nlittle case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow\u2019s nest, within easy\nreach of his hand. \ue053ough, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the\nbrave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should\nso utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it\nmust have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying\nthe mathematics aloft there in that bird\u2019s nest within three or four perches of the\npole.\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet\nand his Greenland-men were; yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by\nthe widely contrasting serenity of those sedu\ue076ive seas in which we South fishers\nmostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the\ntop to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find\nthere; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail\nyard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to my\nultimate destination.\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry\nguard.

Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that\nribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot- prints\u2014the\nfoot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\u201d\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous\nstep that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at\nevery uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle,\nyou could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as\nhe paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward\nmould of every outer movement.\n\u201cD\u2019ye mark him, Flask?\u201d whispered Stubb; \u201dthe chick that\u2019s in him pecks the\nshell.

In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter\nbetween Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them,\nalmost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults\u2014not restri\ue076ed to\nsprained wrists and ancles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations \u2014but fatal to\nthe last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually\ncome.\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify\nthe true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors\nnaturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,\u2014as the smitten\ntree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra\nfirma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to\ncling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness\nof the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen as a\nbody unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors;\nbut of all sailors, they are by all odds the most dire\ue076ly brought into conta\ue076with\nwhatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them.

So that in many cases\nsuch a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard\nof the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of\nhis jaw.\nBut there were still other and more vital pra\ue076ical influences at work.

Nor is the\npre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly\ncomprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times\nthrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists \u2014Olassen and Povelson\u2014declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other\ncreature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst\nfor human blood.

Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in\nsome of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the\ntwo assaults could not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has\nbeen believed by some whalemen, that the nor\u2019 west passage, so long a problem to\nman, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience\nof living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain\nin Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of\nships floated up to the surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the\nHoly Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\nequalled by the realities of the whaleman.\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that\nafter repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot\nbe much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their\nsuperstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted\nin his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be\nmade to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would\nonce more be seen.\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the\nearthly make and incontestable chara\ue076er of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power.

More than all, his treacherous retreats\nstruck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his\nexulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times\nbeen known to turn around suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave\ntheir boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase.

He piled upon the whale\u2019s\nwhite hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from\nAdam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart\u2019s\nshell upon it.\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. \ue053en, in darting at the monster, knife\nin hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and\nwhen he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards\nhome, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and\nso interfusing, made him mad. \ue053at it was only then, on the homeward voyage,\nafter the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain\nfrom the fa\ue076that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and,\nthough unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest,\nand was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace\nhim fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he\nswung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable\nlatitudes, the ship, with mild stun\u2019sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics,\nand, to all appearances, the old man\u2019s delirium seemed left behind him with the\nCape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, colle\ue076ed front, however pale, and issued\nhis calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\nnow gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but\nbecome transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab\u2019s full lunacy subsided not,\nbut deepeningly contra\ue076ed; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in\nhis narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab\u2019s broad madness had been\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intelle\ue076had\nperished. \ue053at before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a\nfurious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried\nit, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from\nhaving lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable\nobje\ue076.\n\ue053is is much; yet Ahab\u2019s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.

But that thing of his dissembling was only subje\ue076to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.

For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading\na maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of\nthat monomaniac thought of his soul.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1620, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "4cd399a7-2235-4580-89e0-d9504489bc19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 169, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a90989ab-a333-4453-938e-01051065fde8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 169, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "e82d84d52071a6f3a526b4b877e0ce78af3a1ac24b2f55e2bc8ed51e08cc28a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a51cf94c-cb93-44b7-8660-4f92534b5ea4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 169, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "7430412053b52f875dc3b105a35d63439a24dd6b4282e04ad2c9ac4823945f05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might\nseem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.

On this hint, attempts have been made to constru\ue076elaborate\nmigratory charts of the Sperm Whale.\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\nSperm Whales, guided by some infallible instin\ue076\u2014say, rather, secret intelligence\nfrom the Deity\u2014mostly swim in\nveins, as they are called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with\nsuch undeviating exa\ue076itude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with\none tithe of such marvellous precision. \ue053ough, in these cases, the dire\ue076ion taken\nby any one whale be straight as a surveyor\u2019s parallel, and though the line of advance\nbe stri\ue076ly confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in\nwhich at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\n(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contra\ue076); but never exceeds\nthe visual sweep from the whale- ship\u2019s mast-heads, when circumspe\ue076ly gliding\nalong this magic zone. \ue053e sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth\nand along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feedinggrounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time\nhimself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospe\ue076of a meeting.\n\ue053ere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme.

In general, the same\nremark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among\nthe matured, aged Sperm Whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year\nbeen seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\nor Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the pequod\nto visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would\ninfallibly encounter him there.

For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\nperiodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual\nround, loiters for a predi\ue076ed interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. \ue053ere it was,\ntoo, that most of the deadly encounters with the White Whale had taken place;\nthere the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where\nthe monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in\nthe cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw\nhis brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest\nall his hopes upon the one crowning fa\ue076above mentioned, however flattering it\nmight be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize\nhis unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to\nmake the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down\nsixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.\n\ue053erefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of\nthe Pequod\u2019s sailing had, perhaps, been corre\ue076ly sele\ue076ed by Ahab, with a view\nto this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance\nthe White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical\nfeeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the\nBengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race. So that\nMonsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter\nand Simoom, might blow Moby Dick into\nthe devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod\u2019s circumnavigating wake.\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a\nmad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if\nencountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter,\neven as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?\nYes.

And here, his mad mind would\nrun on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over\nhim; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah,\nGod! what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one\nunachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his\nown bloody nails in his palms.\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\ndreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day,\ncarried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round\nin his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable\nanguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved\nhis being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked\nflames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down\namong them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would\nbe heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state\nroom, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead\nof being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his\nown resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy\nAhab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the White Whale; this Ahab\nthat had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused\nhim to burst from it in horror again. \ue053e latter was the eternal, living principle\nor soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the chara\ue076erizing\nmind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which,\nfor the time, it was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\nleagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\u2019s case, yielding\nup all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its\nown sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of\nself-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn,\nwhile the common vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from\nthe unbidden and unfathered birth. \ue053erefore, the tormented spirit that glared\nout of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the\ntime but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to\nbe sure, but without an obje\ue076to color, and therefore a blankness in itself.

and, after an interval (in one instance of\nthree years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons,\nboth marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the\ninstance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons;\nand I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa,\nwent ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,\nwhere he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents,\nsavages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to\nwandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck\nmust also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the\nglobe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.

Why such a whale became thus\nmarked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respe\ue076any chance\nwhale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling\nhim down into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the\nfatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he\nwould be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a\nmore intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know\nan irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the\nstreet, lest if they pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary\nthump for their presumption.\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity\u2014nay,\nyou may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he famous in life and now is\nimmortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was admitted into all the rights,\nprivileges, and distin\ue076ions of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses\nor Caesar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an\niceberg, who so long did\u2019st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout\nwas oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand\nJack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at\ntimes assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?

Not\na surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of\nthe crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain\nPollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods\nshipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time\nhis ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted\nit since.

Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be\nsceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so\nsmite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very\ngood; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the commodore set sail in\nthis impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly\nSperm Whale, that begged a few moments\u2019 confidential business with him. that\nbusiness consisted in fetching the Commodore\u2019s craft\nsuch a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest\nport to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore\u2019s interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright?

By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy\nand unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all\naffe\ue076ing the matter presently to be mentioned.\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his\nprefe\ue076ure at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring\nPropontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those\nwaters for a period of more than fifty years. A fa\ue076thus set down in substantial\nhistory cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what\nprecise species this sea- monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships,\nas well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined\nto think a Sperm Whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that\nthe Sperm Whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep\nwaters conne\ue076ing with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and\nperhaps never can be, in the present constitution of\nthings, a place for his habitual gregarious resort.

though he seemed\nready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it may have\nbeen that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman\u2019s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or\nat least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering\nhis monomania, to hint that his vindi\ue076iveness towards\nthe White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\nSperm Whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be\nthe hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there\nwere still additional considerations which, though not so stri\ue076ly according with\nthe wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.\nTo accomplish his obje\ue076Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the\nshadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.

For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less\ncapricious and unreliable\u2014they live in the varying outer weather, and they inhale\nits fickleness\u2014and when retained for any obje\ue076remote and blank in the pursuit,\nhowever promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite\nthat temporary interests and employment should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. \ue053e permanent\nconstitutional condition of the manufa\ue076ured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.\nGranting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and\nplaying round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in\nthem, still, while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also\nhave food for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles\nof land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries, picking\npockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had they been stri\ue076ly\nheld to their one final and romantic obje\ue076\u2014that final and romantic obje\ue076, too\nmany would have turned from in disgust.

And in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other\u2019s track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they are\nequally long absent from home. for one of them may have received a transfer of\nletters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may\nbe for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the\nwhaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all\nthe sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising\nfrom a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that is, so\nlong as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and English.\n\ue053ough, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do\nnot very often occur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness\nbetween them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does\nnot fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers\nsometimes affe\ue076a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers;\nregarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a\nsort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really\nconsist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, colle\ue076ively, kill\nmore whales than all the English, colle\ue076ively, in ten years. But this is a harmless\nlittle foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take\nmuch to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most\nreason to be sociable\u2014and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing\neach other\u2019s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much\nas a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like\na brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical\ncriticism upon each other\u2019s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet\nat sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a\nducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why,\nthey are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as\npossible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other\u2019s cross-bones,\nthe first hail is\u2014\u201cHow many skulls?\u201d\u2014the same way that whalers hail\u2014\u201cHow\nmany barrels?\u201d And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart,\nfor they are infernal villains on both sides, and don\u2019t like to see overmuch of each\nother\u2019s villanous likenesses.\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free-andeasy whaler!

Noun\u2014A social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships, generally on\na cruising- ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats\u2019\ncrews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the\ntwo chief mates on the other.\n\ue053ere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here.\nAll professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale fishery.\nIn a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his\nboat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat\nthere, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner\u2019s tiller decorated with\ngay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort\nwhatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled\nabout the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a\ntiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat\u2019s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or\nharpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion,\nand the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a\npine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole\nvisible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain\nis all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. nor\nis this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense proje\ue076ing steering oar\nhitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by\nrapping his knees in front.

But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that\nrare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to\nquit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in\nrather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working\nat the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more days went\nby, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much\nso, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the\nnearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.\n\u201d\ue053ough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favored,\nhe did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his pumps\nwere of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men\nof his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.\nIn truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous\nbreezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfe\ue076safety at her port\nwithout the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance\nof Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\nLakeman!\u2014Buffalo!

But when Steelkilt made known his determination still\nto lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany,\nmixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a\ndoze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the\nsleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain\nat midnight.\u201d\n\u201c\ue053inking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all\nhis armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the\nscuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was\nshoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of\nsecuring a man who had been fully ripe for murder.

But in order to insure the speediest end to the\nvoyage, they all agreed to another thing\u2014namely, not to sing out for whales, in\ncase any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other\nperils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as\nwilling to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a\nboat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\nBut though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their condu\ue076, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning\nhis own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.

In this attitude, it was well known,\nhe sometimes dozed. \ue053ere was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the\nship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found\nthat his next trick at the helm would come round at two o\u2019clock, in the morning of\nthe third day from that in which he had been betrayed.

But the whale\nrushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and\nrearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\n\u201dMeantime, at the first tap of the boat\u2019s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened\nthe line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought\nhis own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly\nbrought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some\ndistance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney\u2019s red woollen shirt,\ncaught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but\nthe whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\nIn good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\u2014a savage, solitary place\u2014where\nno civilized creature resided. \ue053ere, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of\nthe foremast-men deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned\nout, seizing a large double war- canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other\nharbor.\n\ue053e ship\u2019s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon\nthe Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to\nstop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this\nsmall band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was\nthe hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they\nwere in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in\nso heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far\noff shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked\nhis muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at\ntheir peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat,\nsteered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure\na reinforcement to his crew.\nOn the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have\ntouched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage craft bore\ndown on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would\nrun him under water. the captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow\nof the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if\nthe pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.\n\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d cried the captain.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2956, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "4b4ccb67-0b04-44d6-b5e5-09d1b896362c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 214, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5bf1f388-7a44-4492-9c27-8fc099de02e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 214, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "b104d8d2dbc365e158b543d4dbe3d6c555ec6e772656f2c121b4f45bf617cc6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c26a8cd-f4ea-4422-b21e-65b7c3fb4ef8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 214, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "5cc64c46f6265bca6988b8e9bee4fb800779f6cc75722a0dbe86dfd6617e265f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cWhere are you bound? and for what are you bound?\u201d demanded Steelkilt;\n\u201cno lies.\u201d\n\n\uf645\uf643\uf64a\n\n\n-----\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2956, "end_char_idx": 3052, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "71b0f47c-8550-4087-8b7b-540c169633b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 215, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0846e15f-8d73-4554-a172-03a5603ccf35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 215, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "db584ac014934fbcd9fec087485d8419dec087e63bba344f7d50a8cce8f50a4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "025708a8-efba-4335-a3a4-9ccd381320e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "442a6ac8a4f7dba19ab5f72f05a8e82d3f95184a78bc040bdfaa20403990009f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cI am bound to Tahiti for more men.\u201d\n\u201cVery good.

To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which\napplied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown Sperm Whale, would\nmake the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant\ncaptain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit\nof the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake.

I do not wish to seem\ninelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for\nthe Narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth\ncentury such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public\nof schoolboys.\n\ue053en, again, in \uf644\uf64b\uf645\uf648, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacep\u00e8de, a great naturalist,\npublished a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are several pi\ue076ures of the\ndifferent species of the Leviathan.

In \uf644\uf64b\uf646\uf649, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a pi\ue076ure of\nthe Sperm Whale. Before showing that pi\ue076ure to any Nantucketer, you had best\nprovide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier\u2019s\nSperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the\nbenefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npi\ue076ure, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same\nfield, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer\ncups and saucers inform us.\nAs for the sign-painters\u2019 whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of\noil-dealers, what shall be said of them? \ue053ey are generally Richard III. whales,\nwith dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts,\nthat is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood\nand blue paint.\nBut these manifold mistakes in depi\ue076ing the whale are not so very surprising\nafter all.

And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\nbetween a young sucking whale and a full- grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even\nin the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship\u2019s deck, such\nis then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise\nexpression the devil himself could not catch.\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,\naccurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the\nmore curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of\nhis general shape. \ue053ough Jeremy Bentham\u2019s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra\nin the library of one of his executors, corre\ue076ly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\u2019s other leading personal chara\ue076eristics;\nyet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any Leviathan\u2019s articulated bones.\nIn fa\ue076, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same\nrelation to the fully invested and padded animal as the inse\ue076does to the chrysalis\nthat so roundingly envelopes it. \ue053is peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head,\nas in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously\ndisplayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exa\ue076ly answer to the bones of\nthe human hand, minus only the thumb. \ue053is fin has four regular bone-fingers,\nthe index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged\nin their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. \u201cHowever\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,\u201d said humorous Stubb one day, \u201che\ncan never be truly said to handle us without mittens\u201d.\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain\nunpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exa\ue076ness. So there\nis no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And\nthe only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour,\nis by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being\neternally stove and sunk by him.

But I pass that matter by.\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett\u2019s,\nHuggins\u2019s, Frederick Cuvier\u2019s, and Beale\u2019s. In the previous chapter Colnett and\nCuvier have been referred to. Huggins\u2019s is far better than theirs; but, by great\nodds, Beale\u2019s is the best. All Beale\u2019s drawings of this whale are good, excepting\nthe middle figure in the pi\ue076ure of three whales in various attitudes, capping his\nsecond chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt\ncalculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably corre\ue076\nand life-like in its general effe\ue076.

In the first\nengraving a noble Sperm Whale is depi\ue076ed in full majesty of might, just risen\nbeneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air\nupon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. \ue053e prow of the boat is\npartially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster\u2019s spine; and\nstanding in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold\nan oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the\na\ue076of leaping, as if from a precipice. \ue053e a\ue076ion of the whole thing is wonderfully\ngood and true. \ue053e half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew\nare scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\nblack stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might\nbe found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the\nlife of me, I could not draw so good a one.\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the a\ue076of drawing alongside the barnacled\nflank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea\nlike some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are ere\ue076, full, and\nblack like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would\nthink there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls\nare pecking at the small crabs, shell- fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni,\nwhich the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while\nthe thick-lipped Leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like\na skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. \ue053us, the foreground\nis all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the glassy\nlevel of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and\nthe inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily\nhanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was\neither pra\ue076ically conversant with his subje\ue076, or else marvellously tutored by some\nexperienced whaleman. \ue053e French are the lads for painting a\ue076ion. Go and gaze\nupon all the paintings in Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living\nand breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where\nthe beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of\nFrance; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the successive\narmed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly\nunworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "60baff37-b01d-49db-8bd4-065108e9f13f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 222, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "38c1e0bf-9c8c-43a8-945d-ad8267e01fa1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 222, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "d163aa2d6cde039c5994a0d188f5784ea207708261458755dc85e272f8804d94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d642ab8-fcc4-4192-bc60-86ace6134008", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 222, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "907ea820ea14f909a7d5ae4dc1d011d29283088a41f0d7fef21844db79db967e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\ue053e natural aptitude of the French for seizing the pi\ue076uresqueness of things\nseems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their\nwhaling scenes.

I myself am a savage; owning\nno allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel\nagainst him.\nNow, one of the peculiar chara\ue076eristics of the savage in his domestic hours,\nis his wonderful patience of industry.

No perceptible face or front did it have;\nno conceivable token of either sensation or instin\ue076; but undulated there on the\nbillows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing\nat the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed\u2014\u201cAlmost\nrather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white\nghost!\u201d\n\u201cWhat was it, Sir?\u201c said Flask.\n\u201c\ue053e great live Squid, which they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.\u201c\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest\nas silently following.\nWhatever superstitions the Sperm Whalemen in general have conne\ue076ed with\nthe sight of this obje\ue076, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very unusual, that\ncircumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it beheld,\nthat though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the\nocean, yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true\nnature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the Sperm Whale\nhis only food. For though other species of whales find their food above water, and\nmay be seen by man in the a\ue076of feeding, the Spermaceti Whale obtains his whole\nfood in unknown zones below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one\ncan tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he\nwill disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of\nthem thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. \ue053ey fancy that\nthe monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of\nthe ocean; and that the Sperm Whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth\nin order to attack and tear it.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2718, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "fa54bea5-57b9-45ce-8132-46a9c478a927", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 231, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d44971dd-9e82-4830-bc70-d21819483aa8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 231, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "3c3158b11eb736e78c1a82f0b28de7bcf29ae7b546b628a05468d29c2ce34cb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4380ccb6-c5ba-446b-913e-2e4ed3ea8382", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 231, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "1dffe823d103a525ab6e0eed3fb6a284ad0ae764e0395602f9709220ebf47d10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\ue053ere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. \ue053e manner in which the Bishop\ndescribes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particulars he nar\n\uf645\uf645\uf647\n\n\n-----\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2718, "end_char_idx": 2965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "4e66c6a8-eff6-4f88-8600-0d36c4304e57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 232, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b525e651-fc16-4a43-9bfe-da88f5b923fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 232, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "f6bc653a6986fd573d53fae985fa66b49e38aa8657858e5aece26d053deea00d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "356e5623-494c-4af8-8daa-85828d34fd3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "425b00929e1999081da4610ca511dc583cd8668b4a0e1301236c1236bce50d20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "rates, in all this the two correspond.

for while tar, as\nordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders\nthe rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only\nwould the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling\nto which it must be subje\ue076ed; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\ngeneral by no means adds to the rope\u2019s durability or strength, however much it\nmay give it compa\ue076ness and gloss.\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely\nsuperseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as hemp,\nit is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics\nin all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.\nHemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired\nCircassian to behold.\n\ue053e whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you\nwould not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty yarns will\neach suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope\nwill bear a strain nearly equal to three tons.

Some harpooneers will\nconsume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft\nand then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the a\ue076\nof coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being\ncontinuously coiled in both tubs. \ue053ere is some advantage in this; because these\ntwin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it\nso much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one\nhalf-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\nwill bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub,\nthe boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to\npresent to the whales.\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice\nor loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over\nits edge completely disengaged from everything. \ue053is arrangement of the lower\nend is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it\nof an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should\nsound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\nharpoon.

Second: \ue053is arrangement is indispensable for common safety\u2019s\nsake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were\nthe whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as\nhe sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly\nbe dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no\ntown-crier would ever find her again.\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft\nfrom the tub, and passing round the logger-head there, is again carried forward the\nentire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man\u2019s\noar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men,\nas they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves\nin the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\nof a common quill, prevents it from slipping out.

It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of\nthese perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way\nand the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting\nbuoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and a\ue076ion, can you escape being made\na Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never\npierce you out.\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies\nof the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm\nis but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the\nseemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so\nthe graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before\nbeing brought into a\ue076ual play\u2014this is a thing which carries more of true terror\nthan any other aspe\ue076of this dangerous affair.

And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and\none hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon\nthat inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except\nat long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the\nmass we moved.

Also, that\nin Henry VIIIth\u2019s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward\nfor inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you\nremember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine\neating. \ue053e meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well\nseasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. \ue053e old monks\nof Dunfermline were very fond of them. \ue053ey had a great porpoise grant from the\ncrown.\n\ue053e fa\ue076is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be\nconsidered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come\nto sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your\nappetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of\ncooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they\nlive upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one\nof their most famous do\ue076ors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being\nexceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen,\nwho long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel\u2014that these\nmen a\ue076ually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had\nbeen left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these\nscraps are called \u201cfritters;\u201d which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and\ncrisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives\u2019 dough-nuts or olycooks, when fresh.

But the spermaceti itself,\nhow bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a\ncocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute\nfor butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some\nother substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night it\nis a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots\nand let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made.\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. \ue053e\ncasket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes\nbeing withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed\nwith flour, and cooked into a most dele\ue076able mess, in flavor somewhat resembling\ncalves\u2019 head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that\nsome young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves\u2019 brains,\nby and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf\u2019s\nhead from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.\nAnd that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf\u2019s head\nbefore him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. \ue053e head looks a\nsort of reproachfully at him, with an \u201cEt tu Brute!\u201d expression.\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively un\ue076uous that\nlandsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to result,\nin some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i. e. that a man should\neat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no\ndoubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps\nhe was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have\nbeen; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does.

Already you know\nwhat his blubber is. \ue053at blubber is something of the consistence of firm, closegrained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compa\ue076, and ranges from eight or ten\nto twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature\u2019s skin\nas being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fa\ue076these are no\narguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense\nenveloping layer from the whale\u2019s body but that same blubber; and the outermost\nenveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\nTrue, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your\nhand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest\nshreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous\nto being dried, when it not only contra\ue076s and thickens, but becomes rather hard\nand brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whalebooks.

Reckoning ten\nbarrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of\nthe stuff of the whale\u2019s skin.\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many\nmarvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed\nwith numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those in the finest\nItalian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they\nwere engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the\nquick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford\nthe ground for far other delineations. \ue053ese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you\ncall those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that\nis the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of\nthe hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck with a\nplate representing the old Indian chara\ue076ers chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic\npalisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too,\nthe mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. \ue053is allusion to the Indian\nrocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the\nexterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more\nespecially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason\nof numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspe\ue076. I should say\nthat those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the\nmarks of violent scraping conta\ue076with vast floating icebergs \u2014I should say, that\nthose rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also\nseems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile conta\ue076\nwith other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full- grown bulls\nof the species.\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\nwhale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called\nblanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For\nthe whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or,\nstill better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by\nreason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself\ncomfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.

Now hands are wanted here,and\nthen again hands are wanted there. \ue053ere is no staying in any one place; for at one\nand the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same\nwith him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our\nway a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale\u2019s back,\nthe blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the\nmates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed\nin that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty\nit was, as harpooneer to descend upon the monster\u2019s back for the special purpose\nreferred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded.\n\ue053e whale be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate\nparts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck,\nthe poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as\nthe vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question.\nQueequeg figured in the Highland costume\u2014a shirt and socks\u2014in which to my\neyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance\nto observe him, as will presently be seen.\nBeing the savage\u2019s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his\nboat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him\nwhile taking that hard- scrabble scramble upon the dead whale\u2019s back. You have\nseen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the\nship\u2019s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically\ncalled in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted\nround his waist.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2028, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "7d24acbb-3009-4a61-91fe-7682964374b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 263, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "011c55a9-ba8b-4ed4-881f-1c6419f1ef65", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 263, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "96b005aecaaa426185b39b83918d52bb7408e340dcfaee23528c0790ada20a7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cbd9ece-64f7-4f7b-9a36-f6dccb96fd9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 263, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "778a410a65dc95335e5bf5bf8e8c2e528c701e77e6fb1d28690adb5193464b01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.

Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would I only had\nthe management of it.\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale\nand the ship\u2014where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and\nswaying of both. but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.\nUnappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now\nfreshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from\nthe carcase\u2014the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside\nwith his foundering feet.

You would find that you could only command\nsome thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about\nthirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with\ndagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if\nhe were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so\nto speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that\nmakes the front of a man\u2014what, indeed, but his eyes?\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so\nplanted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one pi\ue076ure\nand not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale\u2019s eyes, effe\ue076ually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like\na great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts. \ue053e whale, therefore,\nmust see one distin\ue076pi\ue076ure on this side, and another distin\ue076pi\ue076ure on that\nside; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man\nmay, in effe\ue076, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined\nsashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted,\nmaking two distin\ue076windows, but sadly impairing the view. \ue053is peculiarity of\nthe whale\u2019s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be\nremembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual\nmatter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a hint. so long as a\nman\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the a\ue076of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot\nthen help mechanically seeing whatever obje\ue076s are before him. Nevertheless, any\none\u2019s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating\nsweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two things\u2014however large or however small\u2014at one and\nthe same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.\nBut if you now come to separate these two obje\ue076s, and surround each by a circle\nof profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as to\nbring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\nthemselves, must simultaneously a\ue076; but is his brain so much more comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man\u2019s, that he can at the same moment of time\nattentively examine two distin\ue076prospe\ue076s, one on one side of him, and the other\nin an exa\ue076ly opposite dire\ue076ion? If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him,\nas if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two\ndistin\ue076problems in Euclid.

If you are an entire stranger\nto their race, you might hunt over these two heads for hours, and never discover\nthat organ. \ue053e ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can\nhardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye.\nWith respe\ue076to their ears, this important difference is to be observed between the\nsperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has an external opening,\nthat of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be\nquite imperceptible from without.\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through\nso small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare\u2019s?\nBut if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel\u2019s great telescope; and his ears\ncapacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight,\nor sharper of hearing? Not at all.\u2014Why then do you try to \u201denlarge\u201c your mind?\nSubtilize it.\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\nover the sperm whale\u2019s head, so that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by\na ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the\nbody is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into\nthe great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by\nthis tooth, and look about us where we are. What a really beautiful and chastelooking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening\nwhite membrane, glossy as bridal satins.\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like\nthe long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with a hinge at one end, instead of\none side.

I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming\nto yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram\npower may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfa\ue076orily\nsettle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most\nappalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded\nhistory.\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the\nfront of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you observe\nthat the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish\nmore of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you\nobserve that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,\nas though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe\nthat the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he has\u2014his spout hole\u2014is\non the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his\nhead, nearly one third of his entire length from the front. Wherefore, you must\nnow have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale\u2019s head is a dead, blind wall,\nwithout a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore,\nyou are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\nof the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get\nnear twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.\nSo that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will\nsoon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are\nnow to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all\nthat apparent effeminacy.

Looking over the side,\nthey saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of\nthe sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to\nwhich he had sunk.\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the\nwhip\u2014which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles \u2014a sharp cracking\nnoise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of the two enormous\nhooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass\nsideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.\n\ue053e one remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed\nevery instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the\nviolent motions of the head.\n\u201cCome down, come down!\u201d yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand\nholding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket\ninto the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it,\nand so be hoisted out.\n\u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, man,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201care you ramming home a cartridge\nthere? \u2014Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on top\nof his head?

But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked figure with\na boarding-sword in its hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over the\nbulwarks. \ue053e next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived\nto the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every\nripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the diver\ncould be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little\noff from the ship.\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust upright from\nthe blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a\ngrave.\n\u201cBoth! both!\u2014it is both! \u2014\u201d.cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\nsoon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and with the\nother clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting boat, they were\nquickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg\ndid not look very brisk.\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\nslowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near\nits bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had thrust\nhis long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the\nhead. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well\nknowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;\u2014he\nhad thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old\nway\u2014head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could\nbe expe\ue076ed.\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the\ndeliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully accomplished, in the\nteeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which is\na lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same\ncourse with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\u2019s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen or heard\nof some one\u2019s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian\u2019s, considering the exceeding\nslipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale\u2019s well.\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the\ntissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky part\nabout him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity\nthan itself.

Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater\nnot only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces\nof horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of\nexpression discernible therein.

Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant\u2019s brow is\nmajestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed\nby the German emperors to their decrees. It signifies \u201cGod: done this day by my\nhand\u201d. But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a\nmere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\nlike Shakespeare\u2019s or Melan\ue076hon\u2019s rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes\nthemselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the\nforehead\u2019s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to\ndrink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great\nSperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so\nimmensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the Deity\nand the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other obje\ue076in living\nnature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distin\ue076feature is revealed;\nno nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one\nbroad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the\ndoom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow\ndiminish; though that way viewed, its grandeur does not domineer upon you so.\nIn profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the\nforehead\u2019s middle, which, in man, is Lavater\u2019s mark of genius.\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written\na book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing nothing\nparticular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And this\nreminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient\nWorld, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. they deified\nthe crocodile of the nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale\nhas no tongue, or as least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2438, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "d9550c73-7128-48d2-bf1a-f28c425e03d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 285, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e547f8b-6b7a-4d46-ac73-bb415992c2a9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 285, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "108293f3a864f2bcc2c99016d48c529e25ffc528e3a0dbf8247450d6cd560968", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ecec1f2-1429-4383-bd91-a9f68124fe4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 285, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "95b9595a91850f39f54ccbeeaf9a8b6dcaeb8741fef71fc67c1e991ba01de2f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e34f9e88-f279-4885-8f72-317b8ca63e3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bf54c599051dc11721f7803bddb074f2a8039fb6719397171c60ca62993358f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right,\nthe merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now\negotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove\u2019s high seat,\nthe great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.

As it passes through the remaining\nvertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large\ncapacity.

Hurrah for the white-ash\nbreeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over him!\u201d\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their gallantry,\nhe would have proved the vi\ue076or in this race, had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman. While\nthis clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence,\nDerick\u2019s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty\nrage;\u2014that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they\ntook a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German\u2019s quarter.\nAn instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale\u2019s immediate\nwake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he\nmade.\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. \ue053e whale was now going\nhead out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet; while his\none poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he\nyawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have\nI seen a bird with clipped wing, making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly\nstriving to escape the piratical hawks.

Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting mail!\nBut the monster\u2019s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously\nsounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the loggerheads with\nsuch a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their\ndexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on;\ntill at last\u2014owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the\nboats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue\u2014the gunwales of\nthe bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the\nair. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they remained in that\nattitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.\nBut though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \u201cholding\non,\u201c as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the\nback; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet\nthe sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be\ndoubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable to presume,\nthat the longer the stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted.\nBecause, owing to the enormous surface of him\u2014in a full grown Sperm Whale\nsomething less than \uf645\uf643\uf643\uf643square feet\u2014the pressure of the water is immense.

It must at least equal\nthe weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of\ntwenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its\neternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so much as\na ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman would have thought,\nthat beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was\nwrithing and wrenching in agony!

Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been\nsuch huge phantoms flitting over his head!\n\u201cStand by, men; he stirs,\u201d cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly vibrated\nin the water, distin\ue076ly condu\ue076ing upwards to them, as by magnetic wires, the life\nand death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his seat. \ue053e\nnext moment, relieved in a great part from the downward strain at the bows, the\nboats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small ice-field will, when a dense herd\nof white bears are scared from it into the sea.\n\u201cHaul in! Haul in!\u201d cried Starbuck again; \u201che\u2019s rising\u201d.\n\ue053e lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand\u2019s breadth could\nhave been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the\nboats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship\u2019s lengths of the hunters.\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when\nwounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire\nnonvalvular stru\ue076ure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a\npoint as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system;\nand when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams.\nYet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\nfountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period;\neven as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off\nand undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and\nperilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they\nwere followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually\nplaying, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however\nrapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood\nyet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they\nsignificantly call it, was untouched.\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his\nform, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes,\nor rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld.

At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet\nshot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish,\nthe whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft,\nbespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing\nFlask\u2019s boat and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so\nspent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he\nhad made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then\nover and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of\nhis belly; lay like a log, and died.

Immediately, by Starbuck\u2019s\norders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that ere long every boat was a\nbuoy; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.\nBy very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\nto her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was\nplain that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the entire\nlength of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the lower part\nof the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found\nin the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfe\ue076ly healed around them,\nand no prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs\nhave been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the\nulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fa\ue076of a lance-head of stone\nbeing found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfe\ue076ly firm about it.\nWho had darted that stone lance? And when? It might have been darted by some\nNor\u2019 West Indian long before America was discovered.\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet\nthere is no telling.

For young whales,\nin the highest health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in\nthe warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even these\nbrawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident\nthan any other species.

But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing\nout from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules\nand the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions\ndid not make those traditions one whit the less fa\ue076s, for all that.\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\u2019s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\nstory was this:\u2014He had one of those quaint old- fashioned Bibles, embellished\nwith curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah\u2019s whale with two\nspouts in his head \u2014a peculiarity only true with respe\ue076to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the\nfishermen have this saying, \u201cA penny roll would choke him;\u201d his swallow is so very\nsmall. But, to this, Bishop Jebb\u2019s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,\nhints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale\u2019s belly, but as\ntemporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough\nin the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale\u2019s mouth would accommodate a\ncouple of whist tables, and comfortably seat all the players.

Poor Sag- Harbor, therefore, seems\nworsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean\nSea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days\u2019 journey\nof Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days\u2019 journey across\nfrom the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short\ndistance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the\nCape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length\nof the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such\na supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three\ndays, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow\nfor any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah\u2019s weathering the Cape of\nGood Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great\nheadland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern\nhistory a liar.\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish\npride of reason\u2014a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but\nlittle learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only\nshows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the\nreverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah\u2019s going\nto Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification\nof the general miracle. And so it was.

How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his\nspine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like\nvessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with\noxygenated blood.

And not\ntill those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term\nbelow. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are different; but\nin any one they are alike.

But then again, what has\nthe whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything\nto say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the\nconveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the\nupper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much\nlike a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns\nwhether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of\nthe Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled\nbreath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the\nspiracle. It is certain that the mouth indire\ue076ly communicates with the spouting\ncanal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\nthrough the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to\nbe, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s food\nis far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides,\nif you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that\nwhen unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets\nand the ordinary periods of respiration.\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subje\ue076? Speak out! You\nhave seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from\nair? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things.

And if at such times you should\nthink that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know\nthat they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they\nare not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which\nis countersunk into the summit of the whale\u2019s head?

It will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting\nhis face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring\nit away. For even when coming into slight conta\ue076with the outer, vapory shreds of\nthe jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness\nof the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer conta\ue076\nwith the spout, whether with some scientific obje\ue076in view, or otherwise, I cannot\nsay, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen,\nthe spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.

My hypothesis\nis this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this\nconclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity\nand sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,\ninasmuch as it is an undisputed fa\ue076that he is never found on soundings, or near\nshores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And\nI am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain\nsemi-visible steam, while in the a\ue076of thinking deep thoughts. While composing\na little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and\nere long saw refle\ue076ed there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the\natmosphere over my head. \ue053e invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in\ndeep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August\nnoon; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold\nhim solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung\nby a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and\nthat vapor\u2014as you will sometimes see it\u2014glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven\nitself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d\u2019ye see, rainbows do not visit the\nclear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim\ndoubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog\nwith a heavenly ray.

In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than\nin the crescentic borders of these flukes.

On the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling beauty from\nit. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in\neverything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic.

As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet\nfrom the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of\nthe man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.

And whatever they\nmay reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian\npi\ue076ures, in which his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pi\ue076ures,\nso destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere\nnegative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar pra\ue076ical virtues of his teachings.\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether wielded in\nsport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions are\ninvariably marked by exceeding grace. \ue053erein no fairy\u2019s arm can transcend it.\nFive great motions are peculiar to it.

It never wriggles. In man or\nfish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the whale, his tail is the sole means\nof propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly\nsprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to\nthe monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights another\nSperm Whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his confli\ue076s with man, he\nchiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves\naway his flukes from it, and the blow is only infli\ue076ed by the recoil. If it be made in\nthe unobstru\ue076ed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies\nin eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water, then partly\nowing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat, and the elasticity of its materials,\na cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally\nthe most serious result. \ue053ese submerged side blows are so often received in the\nfishery, that they are accounted mere child\u2019s play.

On more accounts than one, a pity it is\nthat the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard\nof yet another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk\nand extra\ue076ed the dart.\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle\nof solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and\nkitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you see his power\nin his play. \ue053e broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the\nsurface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from\nthe spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from\nthe touch-hole.\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the Leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes\nwith at least thirty feet of his body are tossed ere\ue076in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.

To this aggregation of the\nSperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that\neven in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and\nmonths together, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly\nsaluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and forming\na great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain of\nwhale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the straight\nperpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, falls over in\ntwo branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forwardslanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,\ncontinually rising and falling away to leeward.\nSeen from the Pequod\u2019s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the\nsea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air, and beheld\nthrough a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the thousand cheerful\nchimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by\nsome horseman on a height.\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear, and once\nmore expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did this vast fleet of\nwhales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contra\ue076ing the\nwings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling\ntheir weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats.\nIf the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits\nof Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the\ncapture of not a few of their number.

Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over\nthe pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is chara\ue076eristic of almost all herding\ncreatures. \ue053ough banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman.

In\nabout three minutes\u2019 time, Queequeg\u2019s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted\nblinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\nstraight for the heart of the herd. \ue053ough such a movement on the part of the\nwhale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is\nalmost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\nvicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper\ninto the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspe\ue076life and only exist in a delirious\nthrob.\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed\nto rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white\ngash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro\nrushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest,\nand striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not\nat what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from\nthis monster dire\ue076ly across our route in advance; now edging away from that,\nwhose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood\nup in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could\nreach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones.

Two thick squares of wood of equal size are\nstoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other\u2019s grain at right angles; a\nline of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the\nother end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon.\nIt is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales\nare close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But Sperm Whales\nare not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can.\nAnd if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can\nbe afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg\ncomes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. \ue053e first\nand second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running\noff, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. \ue053ey were\ncramped like malefa\ue076ors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in\nthe a\ue076of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the\nseats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the\noarsman in the boat\u2019s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the\nsea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts\nin, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not\nthat as we advanced into the herd, our whale\u2019s way greatly diminished; moreover,\nthat as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion, the\ndireful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew\nout, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his\nparting momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\nshoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here\nthe storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not\nfelt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called\na sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet\nmoods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart\nof every commotion.

Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas\nseemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond.

But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of\nthe fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed;\nhe had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the\nrope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoonline round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So\nthat tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently\nflailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and\nmurdering his own comrades.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2858, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "e955c812-3958-4595-a95e-7c3cf24d1f6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 318, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "da61ddc7-c1d9-4844-a6d8-95a59f1a41de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 318, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "333f1c2976e7b91ba3bd74ab7eb446cbe640ac651592047672c012a41a70d64e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ae6c67e-3ec3-4d1f-88eb-f4d105518135", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 318, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "6166facde51f9482b75478a83adbb252d8efc5e165f304f59bd81f2814347517", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\ue053is terrific obje\ue076seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright.\nFirst, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little, and tumble\nagainst each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself\n\n\uf646\uf644\uf644\n\n\n-----\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2858, "end_char_idx": 3124, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "bb28c2a5-8e2b-4837-b215-8b3d14bf4729", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 319, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c79d5e6a-b541-44af-9092-d2ed3136e5cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 319, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "4b7834ce154b73884c345307e70dc71f1b6103f6f597fb830af34beeccf4adae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a09c063d-647f-4294-80c0-66cf1e4eb0e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7bfde55ff4d65551ee9d3e48d30073283a69b199c9a035778bee7c6d464445e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries\nvanished; in more and more contra\ue076ing orbits the whales in the more central\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters.

For example,\u2014after a weary and perilous\nchase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of\na violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler,\nwho, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. \ue053us the most\nvexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there\nnot some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative ena\ue076ment, was\nthat of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A. D. \uf644\uf649\uf64c\uf648.

True, among the more upright and honorable whalemen\nallowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous\nmoral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or\nkilled by another party. But others are by no means so scrupulous.\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the\nfish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their\nlines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship)\ncame up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before\nthe very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated with,\ntheir captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs\u2019 teeth, and assured them that by\nway of doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the\nseizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their\nwhale, line, harpoons, and boat.\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge.\nIn the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position,\nby alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying\nto bridle his wife\u2019s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but\nin the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an a\ue076ion to recover\npossession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by\nsaying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once\nhad her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had\nas last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\ntherefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became\nthat subsequent gentleman\u2019s property, along with whatever harpoon might have\nbeen found sticking in her.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2667, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "22063b9c-efef-4bfc-a354-2c44108010c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 325, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "148d61ac-56b4-49f6-801a-cc0c6fc980dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 325, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "fdd58dd40bdaf3caa353203ac5a588f3cd476a1cf3654c191cc3037f0bc41e72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87550c49-1987-43fa-8831-c6688ec9c904", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 325, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "1cb59cb61eb22a9fdda30b742998c42468b01bb56c894551f2b608874db4a052", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and\nthe lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\n\ue053ese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned\njudge in set terms decided, to wit,\u2014\ue053at as for the boat, he awarded it to the\nplaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with\nregard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the de\n\uf646\uf644\uf64b\n\n\n-----\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2667, "end_char_idx": 3130, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "5675d60b-ad1f-49d1-bec2-7669a7482c69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 326, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d50495de-4b7e-4611-97bc-28cd0239d4f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 326, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "c7aef2545cb2cf7b08dc86bae7433a0db6d6f18f071a98ba38ad293aea3587aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "526490ef-684e-484f-a169-18c3e6d21c93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "152a557720e8823e9e9f745d8c5a3d9d99d7ecc01ca639a3952007d052b25fcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "fendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture;\nand the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the\nfish had a right to them.

But come aboard, and\nmayhap he\u2019ll believe you, if he won\u2019t me; and so I\u2019ll get out of this dirty scrape\u201d.\n\u201cAnything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\u201d rejoined Stubb, and\nwith that he soon mounted to the deck. \ue053ere a queer scene presented itself. \ue053e\nsailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness\nfor the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in\nanything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly proje\ue076ed from their faces\nlike so many jib- booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and\nrun up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the\nplague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils.

Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning\nthe ambergris.

According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man,\nunder cover of an interpreter\u2019s office, was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but\nas coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should\ncome uppermost in him during the interview.\nBy this time their destined vi\ue076im appeared from his cabin.

Also forget not the strange fa\ue076that\nof all things of ill- savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufa\ue076uring stages,\nis the worst.\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in\nthe estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered as indire\ue076ly\nsubstantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman\u2019s two whales. Elsewhere\nin this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of\nwhaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\nrebut. \ue053ey hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma\noriginate?\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling\nships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen did not\nthen, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always\ndone; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung\nholes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season\nin those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,\nforbidding any other course. \ue053e consequence is, that upon breaking into the\nhold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor\nis given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard, for the foundations of a Lying- in Hospital.\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise\nimputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch\nvillage called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by\nthe learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a textbook on that subje\ue076.\nAs its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order\nto afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without\nbeing taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a colle\ue076ion of furnaces,\nfat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave\nforth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm\nWhaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold\nwith oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and\nin the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. \ue053e truth is, that living or\ndead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill\nodor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affe\ue076ed\nto dete\ue076a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly\nbe otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;\ntaking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\nopen air.

Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must\nremember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy- jolly.\nIn outer aspe\ue076, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a\nwhite one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar color, driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his\nintelle\ue076s, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that\npleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all\nholidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race.

After being severed from\nthe whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer.\n\ue053ey look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\nwhale\u2019s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and often participating to a considerable degree in its un\ue076uousness. It is a most refreshing,\nconvivial, beautiful obje\ue076to behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly\nrich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots\nof the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in pi\ue076ures of citron.\nSpite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I\nstole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a royal\ncutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have\nbeen killed the first day after the venison season, and that particular venison season\ncontemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\n\ue053ere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the\ncourse of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the whalemen, and even\nso is the nature of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent\ndecanting.

It designates the dark, glutinous\nsubstance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale, and much\nof which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\nNippers. Stri\ue076ly this word is not indigenous to the whale\u2019s vocabulary. But as\napplied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman\u2019s nipper is a short firm strip of\ntendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan\u2019s tail: it averages an inch\nin thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise\nmoved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless\nblandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to\ndescend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates. \ue053is place\nhas previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript\nand hoisted from the whale.

With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and\nstrives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile,\nthe spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the\nportable horse-pieces. \ue053is spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan\u2019s\nfeet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from\nhim, like a sledge.

She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining\nwith oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. it is as if from the open\nfield a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.\n\ue053e try-works are planted between the foremast and main-mast, the most\nroomy part of the deck. \ue053e timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted\nto sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet\nby eight square, and five in height. \ue053e foundation does not penetrate the deck,\nbut the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\nwith wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway.\nRemoving this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of\nseveral barrels\u2019 capacity. When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver\npunch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into\nthem and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing\nthem\u2014one man in each pot, side by side\u2014many confidential communications\nare carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical\nmeditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indire\ue076ly struck by the remarkable fa\ue076,\nthat in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example,\nwill descend from any point in precisely the same time.\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of\nthat side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces, dire\ue076ly\nunderneath the pots. \ue053ese mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron.

It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.\n\u201cAll ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the works.\u201d\n\ue053is was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the\nfurnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first\nfire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After that no wood is used,\nexcept as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried\nout, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains considerable of its un\ue076uous properties. \ue053ese fritters feed the flames. Like a plethoric\nburning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body. Would that he consumed his own\nsmoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only\nthat, but you must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo\nodor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the\nleft wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the carcase;\nsail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was intense.\nBut that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at intervals forked forth\nfrom the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the\nfamed Greek fire. \ue053e burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned\nto some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur- freighted brigs of the bold\nHydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame\nfor sails, bore down upon the turkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.\n\ue053e hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth\nin front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship\u2019s stokers. With huge pronged poles they pitched\nhissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till\nthe snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. \ue053e\nsmoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch\nof the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite\nthe mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the\nwindlass. \ue053is served for a sea-sofa.

On its round border it bore the letters, R\uf765\uf770\uf775\uf762\uf76c\uf769\uf763\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf76cE\uf763\uf775\uf761\uf764\uf76f\uf772:\n\uf771\uf775\uf769\uf774\uf76f. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world,\nand beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway\nup the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those\nletters you saw the likeness of three Andes\u2019 summits; from one a flame; a tower\non another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of\nthe partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the\nkeystone sun entering the equino\ue076ial point at Libra.\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.\n\u201c\ue053ere\u2019s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other\ngrand and lofty things; look here,\u2014three peaks as proud as Lucifer. \ue053e firm\ntower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted,\nand vi\ue076orious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but\nthe image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician\u2019s glass, to each and every\nman in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains\nfor those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now\nthis coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the\nequinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!\nFrom storm to storm!

I wont smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars,\nand here\u2019s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy \u2019em out.\u201d\n\u201cShall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish look\nto it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast;\nhere comes our old Manxman\u2014the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is,\nbefore he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round\non the other side of the mast; why, there\u2019s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and\nnow he\u2019s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he\u2019s muttering\u2014voice like an\nold worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!\u201d\n\u201cIf the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the sun\nstands in some one of these signs. I\u2019ve studied signs, and know their marks; they\nwere taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in\nwhat sign will the sun then be? \ue053e horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite\nthe gold. And what\u2019s the horse-shoe sign? \ue053e lion is the horse-shoe sign \u2014the\nroaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.\u201d\n\u201c\ue053ere\u2019s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in one kind\nof world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg\u2014all tattooing\u2014looks like\nthe signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the Cannibal? As I live he\u2019s comparing\nnotes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or\nin the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon\u2019s Astronomy in the back\ncountry. And by Jove, he\u2019s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh\u2014I\nguess it\u2019s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don\u2019t know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king\u2019s trowsers. But, aside again! here\ncomes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the\ntoes of his pumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only\nmakes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin\u2014fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho!

How long, prior to the\nyear of our Lord \uf644\uf64a\uf64a\uf648, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (\uf644\uf64a\uf64a\uf648) it fitted out the first\nEnglish ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score\nof years previous (ever since \uf644\uf64a\uf645\uf649) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket\nand the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North\nand South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distin\ue076ly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great\nSperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole\nglobe who so harpooned him.\nIn \uf644\uf64a\uf64a\uf64b, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at\nthe sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was\nthe first among the nations to lower a whale- boat of any sort in the great South\nSea. \ue053e voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with\nher hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia\u2019s example was soon followed by\nother ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the\nPacific were thrown open.

I impute it, though, to their\nnaturally un\ue076uous natures, being rendered still more un\ue076uous by the nature of\ntheir vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar\nSeas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives\npledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\n\ue053e quantity of beer, too, is very large, \uf644\uf643,\uf64b\uf643\uf643barrels. Now, as those polar\nfisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate, so that the\nwhole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short voyage to and\nfrom the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning\n\uf646\uf643men to each of their fleet of \uf644\uf64b\uf643sail, we have \uf648,\uf647\uf643\uf643Low Dutch seamen in all;\ntherefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks\u2019\nallowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that \uf648\uf648\uf643ankers of gin. Now, whether\nthese gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been,\nwere the right sort of men to stand up in a boat\u2019s head, and take good aim at flying\nwhales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit\nthem too. But this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well\nwith the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be\napt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and\ngrievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of\ntwo or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers have not\nnegle\ue076ed so excellent an example.

Not to tell over\nagain his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about the waist;\nonly think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like\ngreat cables and hausers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-ofbattle-ship.\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behoves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking the minutest\nseminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his\nbowels. Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the\nLeviathan\u2014to an ant or a flea\u2014such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.

No great and enduring\nvolume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.\nEre entering upon the subje\ue076of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a\ngeologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason, and\nalso a great digger of ditches, canals, and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of\nall sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while\nin the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost\ncompletely extin\ue076; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary\nformations seem the conne\ue076ing, or at any rate intercepted links, between the\nantichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered\nthe Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period,\nwhich is the last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently\nakin to them in general respe\ue076s, to justify their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and\nskeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at the base\nof the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of\nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of such remains\nis part of a skull, which in the year \uf644\uf64a\uf64a\uf64cwas disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in\nParis, a short street opening almost dire\ue076ly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and\nbones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon\u2019s time.\nCuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown\nLeviathanic species.\nBut by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete\nvast skeleton of an extin\ue076monster, found in the year \uf644\uf64b\uf647\uf645, on the plantation of\nJudge Creagh, in Alabama. \ue053e awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took\nit for the bones of one of the fallen angels. \ue053e Alabama do\ue076ors declared it a huge\nreptile, and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones\nof it being taken across the sea to owen, the english anatomist, it turned out that\nthis alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species.\nA significant illustration of the fa\ue076, again and again repeated in this book,\nthat the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully\ninvested body.

And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales,\nin the very beginning of his work (page \uf646), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was published\nso late as A. D. \uf644\uf64b\uf645\uf648.\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. \ue053e whale of to-day is as\nbig as his ancestors in Pliny\u2019s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman\n(more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand\nhow it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years\nbefore even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern\nKentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the\noldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are\ndrawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield,\nnot only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh\u2019s fat kine; in\nthe face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have\ndegenerated.\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite\nNantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mastheads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through Behring\u2019s straits, and into\nthe remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons\nand lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he\nmust not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last\nman, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\nwhich, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois\nand Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted\nbrows upon the sites of populous river- capitals, where now the polite broker sells\nyou land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would\nseem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. \ue053ough so short a period\nago\u2014not a good life-time \u2014the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the\ncensus of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or\nhoof of them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this wondrous\nextermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt\nperemptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.

At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try-works.\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1882, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, {"id_": "01aa353a-6b4f-4d6e-a86f-c9b07011b310", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 383, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e23e6381-64be-4268-8147-30ea3407b594", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 383, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "0fa60f767571a9ab443f57d26eaa01d94bc6e1c95685221998802573ac7a1e09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "275d6202-4192-47ad-8725-e4cb5aeb19b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"format": "PDF 1.4", "title": "Herman Melville, Moby Dick", "author": "", "subject": "", "keywords": "", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package", "producer": "xdvipdfmx (0.7.3)", "creationDate": "D:20100314030920-04'00'", "modDate": "", "trapped": "", "encryption": null, "page": 383, "total_pages": 468, "file_path": "data/herman-melville-moby-dick.pdf"}, "hash": "7d7f8857541681d45e804af3bd0adc5d1d21aa828e97a4b0a9c17ecb32c7a2e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files it smaller.

An oarsman sprains his wrist:\nthe carpenter conco\ue076s a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to\nbe painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of\nwood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a\nfancy to wear shark-bone ear- rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has\nthe toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench\nbids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter\nsigns him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\n\ue053us, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and without\nrespe\ue076in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks;\nmen themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field\nthus variously accomplished, and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too;\nall this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not\nprecisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in\nthe whole visible world; which while pauselessly a\ue076ive in uncounted modes, still\neternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\nall-ramifying heartlessness;\u2014yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutchlike, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a\ncertain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the\nmidnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah\u2019s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only\nhad gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward\nclingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstra\ue076; an\nunfra\ue076ioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this\nstrange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his\nnumerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instin\ue076, or\nsimply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even\nor uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process.\nHe was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early\noozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those unreasoning\nbut still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior\u2014though a little swelled \u2014of a common pocket knife; but containing, not\nonly blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\npens, rulers, nail-filers, counter-sinkers.

And a well, or an\nice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the\nheat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last,\nafter some days\u2019 suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of the\ndoor of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days,\ntill there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else\nin him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed\ngrowing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but\ndeeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that\nimmortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like circles\non the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding\nand rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would\nsteal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange\nthings in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For\nwhatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or\nbooks. And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all\nwith a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.\nSo that\u2014let us say it again\u2014no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier\nthoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of\npoor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea\nseemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean\u2019s invisible flood-tide\nlifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what\nhe thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked.

You would have almost\nthought they were pulling down the cursed Bastile, such wild cries they raised, as\nthe now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea.\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood ere\ue076on the ship\u2019s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him, and\nseemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a\nstubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\u2019s wakes\u2014one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to come \u2014their two\ncaptains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.\n\u201cCome aboard, come aboard!\u201d cried the gay Bachelor\u2019s commander, lifting a\nglass and a bottle in the air.\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d gritted Ahab in reply.\n\u201cNo; only heard of him; but don\u2019t believe in him at all,\u201d said the other goodhumoredly. \u201cCome aboard!\u201d\n\u201c\ue053ou are too damned jolly.

Come along, will ye\n(merry\u2019s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.\u201d\n\u201cHow wondrous familiar is a fool!\u201d muttered Ahab; then aloud, \u201c\ue053ou art a\nfull ship and homeward bound, thou sayest; well, then, call me an empty ship,\nand outward-bound.

In good time the order came. It\nwas hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat,\nwas about taking his wonted daily obervation of the sun to determine his latitude.\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences.\n\ue053at unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean\u2019s\nimmeasureable burning-glass. \ue053e sky looks lacquered; clouds there are none;\nthe horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable\nsplendors of God\u2019s throne. Well that Ahab\u2019s quadrant was furnished with colored\nglasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated\nform to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed\nto his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise\ninstant when the sun should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole\nattention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship\u2019s deck,\nand with face thrown up like Ahab\u2019s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the\nlids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly\npassionlessness. At length the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil\nupon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise\ninstant. \ue053en falling into a moment\u2019s revery, he again looked up towards the sun\nand murmured to himself: \u201c\ue053ou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\ntellest me truly where I am\u2014but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or\ncanst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is\nMoby Dick?

Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So,\ntoo, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst\nof all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky,\nlike an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.\nTowards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and barepoled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her dire\ue076ly ahead. When\ndarkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the thunder, and blazed with\nthe lightning, that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the\nrags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport.\nHolding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every\nflash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster might have\nbefallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were dire\ue076ing the men\nin the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed\nnaught. \ue053ough lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat\n(Ahab\u2019s) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling\nship\u2019s high tetering side, stove in the boat\u2019s bottom at the stern, and left it again,\nall dripping through like a sieve.\n\u201cBad work, bad work!

You see, Mr. Starbuck, a\nwave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round the world it runs, and\nthen comes the spring! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across\nthe deck here. But never mind; it\u2019s all in fun: so the old song says;\u201c\u2014(sings).

In a severe gale like\nthis, while the ship is but a tossed shuttle-cock to the blast, it is by no means\nuncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.\nIt was thus with the Pequod\u2019s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed\nto notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight\nthat hardly any one can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion. Some\nhours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the strenuous\nexertions of Starbuck and Stubb\u2014one engaged forward and the other aft\u2014the\nshivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the\nspars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which\nsometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing. \ue053e\nthree corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trysail was\nset further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision\nagain; and the course\u2014for the present, East- south-east\u2014which he was to steer, if\npra\ue076icable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the\ngale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing\nthe ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a\ngood sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye! the foul breeze became\nfair!\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of \u201dHo! the fair wind!

In\ninstances where the lightning has a\ue076ually struck the vessel, so as to smite down\nsome of the spars and rigging, the effe\ue076upon the needle has at times been still\nmore fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic\nsteel was of no more use than an old wife\u2019s knitting needle. But in either case, the\nneedle never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if\nthe binnacle compasses be affe\ue076ed, the same fate reaches all the others that may\nbe in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the precise\nbearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exa\ue076ly inverted, shouted out\nhis orders for the ship\u2019s course to be changed accordingly. \ue053e yards were hard up;\nand once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind,\nfor the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,\nbut quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask\u2014who in some\nsmall degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings\u2014likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab\nwas greater than their fear of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab\u2019s.\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.

Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them\ndown tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship\u2019s stern.

But I\u2019m made of knotty\nAroostook hemlock; I don\u2019t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with\na grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads\nand card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the\njob, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it\nbe too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. hem! i\u2019ll do the job,\nnow, tenderly.

Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different\nrelations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\nthe deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast\ndown from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a\nconstant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be\ncast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab\u2019s proceedings in this matter\nwere not unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,\nalmost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in\nthe slightest degree approaching to decision \u2014one of those too, whose faithfulness\non the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;\u2014it was strange, that this was\nthe very man he should sele\ue076for his watchman;
