Some years ago\u2014never mind how long precisely\u2014having little\nor no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought\nI would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have\nof driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself\ngrowing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my\nsoul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos\nget such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent\nme from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\u2019s\nhats off\u2014then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. \ue053is is my\nsubstitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself\nupon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. \ue053ere is nothing surprising in this. If", "substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself\nupon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. \ue053ere is nothing surprising in this. If\nthey but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very\nnearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\n\ue053ere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as\nIndian isles by coral reefs\u2014commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left,\nthe streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that\nnoble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous\nwere out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you\nsee?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some", "see?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some\nseated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China;\nsome high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But\nthese are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster\u2014tied to counters,\nnailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone?", "\uf644\n\n\n-----", "What do they here?\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly\nbound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of\nthe land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No.\n\ue053ey must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And\nthere they stand\u2014miles of them\u2014leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes\nand alleys, streets and avenues,\u2014north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all\nunite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\nthose ships attra\ue076them thither?\nOnce more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and\nleaves you there by a pool in the stream. \ue053ere is magic in it.

Let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries\u2014stand that man on his legs,\nset his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in\nall that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.\nYes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest,\nmost enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is\nthe chief element he employs? \ue053ere stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,\nas if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there\nsleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains", "sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains\nbathed in their hill-side blue. But though the pi\ue076ure lies thus tranced, and though\nthis pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\u2019s head, yet all\nwere vain, unless the shepherd\u2019s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.\nGo visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade kneedeep among Tiger- lilies\u2014what is the one charm wanting?\u2014Water\u2014there is not\na drop of water there! Were Niagara but a catara\ue076of sand, would you travel your\nthousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly\nreceiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he\nsadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why\nis almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time", "sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why\nis almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time\nor other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you\nyourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were\nnow out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not\nwithout meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who\nbecause he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,\nplunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all\nrivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is", "\uf645\n\n\n-----", "the key to it all.\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow\nhazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean\nto have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you\nmust needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.\nBesides, passengers get sea-sick\u2014grow quarrelsome\u2014don\u2019t sleep of nights\u2014do\nnot enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;\u2014no, I never go as a passenger;\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a\nCaptain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distin\ue076ion of such offices to those\nwho like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respe\ue076able toils, trials,\nand tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take\ncare of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what\nnot. And as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory in", "care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what\nnot. And as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory in\nthat, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I never fancied\nbroiling fowls; \u2014though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically\nsalted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respe\ue076fully, not to say\nreverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the\nold Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies\nof those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb\ndown into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather\norder me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in\na May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches", "order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in\na May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches\none\u2019s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the\nland, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a\ncountry schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. \ue053e transition\nis a keen one, I assure you, from the schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong\ndeco\ue076ion of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this\nwears off in time.\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and\nsweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean,\nin the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks\nanything the less of me, because I promptly and respe\ue076fully obey that old hunks", "in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks\nanything the less of me, because I promptly and respe\ue076fully obey that old hunks\nin that particular instance? Who aint a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however\nthe old sea-captains may order me about\u2014however they may thump and punch\nme about, I have the satisfa\ue076ion of knowing that it is all right; that everybody\nelse is one way or other served in much the same way\u2014either in a physical or\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round,\nand all hands should rub each other\u2019s shoulder-blades, and be content.\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for", "\uf646\n\n\n-----", "my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of.\nOn the contrary, passengers themselves must pay.

Indeed, partly lying on\nit as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so\nblended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure\nthat I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\nMy sensations were strange.

I felt dreadfully. But there was no help\nfor it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as\nslowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.", "for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as\nslowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I\ncould hope for a resurre\ue076ion. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached\nto think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a\ngreat rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the\nhouse.

But she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and\nback I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling\na great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent\nmisfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\nslowly waking from it\u2014half steeped in dreams\u2014I opened my eyes, and the before\nsun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.

My arm hung over the counterpane,\nand the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, sseated by my bedside. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I\nknew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the\nmorning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months\nafterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to\nthis very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural\nhand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\u2019s pagan arm thrown round me.

For though I tried to move his\narm\u2014unlock his bridegroom clasp\u2014yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me\ntightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\nhim\u2014\u201cQueequeg!\u201d\u2014but his only answer was a snore.

A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a\nstrange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in\nthe name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling,", "strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in\nthe name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling,\nand loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging\na fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extra\ue076ing a grunt;\nand presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland\ndog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me,\nand rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there,\nthough a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him.

I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of\ngreat rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;\nfor the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man\nlike Queequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual\nregarding.\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\nby the by, and then\u2014still minus his trowsers\u2014he hunted up his boots.

But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\nstate \u2014neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off\nhis outlandishness in the strangest possible manner. his education was not yet\ncompleted. He was an undergraduate.

He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time", "to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as\nsoon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time\nin the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\namazement, contented himself with restri\ue076ing his ablutions to his chest, arms,\nand hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on\nthe wash-stand centre-table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his\nface.

Afterwards I\nwondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the\nhead of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are\nalways kept. \ue053e rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched\nout of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\nharpoon like a marshal\u2019s baton.\n\n\uf645\uf646\n\n\n-----\n\n### CHAPTER V.\n\n## THE STREET", "If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual\nas Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of\nNew Bedford.\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer\nto view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts.

In his System of Nature, A.

Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground\nthat the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. \ue053is fundamental\nthing settled, the next point is, in what internal respe\ue076does the whale differ from\nother fish.

Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these:\nlungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting\nfish with a horizontal tail. \ue053ere you have him. However contra\ue076ed, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale,\nbut the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. but the last term of the\ndefinition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must\nhave noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical,\nor up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be\nsimilarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the", "similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the\nleviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the\nbest informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto\nauthoritatively regarded as alien.

Great\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and\nlike one of Hercules\u2019 pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur\nbeyond which few mortals will go.

And it is much to be deplored that the place\nto which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural\nlife, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness,\nor adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a\nhammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and\nsnug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves.

With greedy ears I learned\nthe history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken\nour oaths of violence and revenge.\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded\nWhite Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm\nWhale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them,\ncomparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had a\ue076ually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.

It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale\nof uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief\nto his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than", "to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than\nmoby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various\nand not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to\nMoby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the", "\uf644\uf647\uf649\n\n\n-----", "peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at\nlarge, than to the individual cause.

But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults\u2014not restri\ue076ed to\nsprained wrists and ancles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations \u2014but fatal to\nthe last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually\ncome.\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify", "come.\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify\nthe true histories of these deadly encounters.

And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness\nof the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen as a\nbody unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors;\nbut of all sailors, they are by all odds the most dire\ue076ly brought into conta\ue076with\nwhatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them.

So that in many cases\nsuch a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard\nof the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of\nhis jaw.\nBut there were still other and more vital pra\ue076ical influences at work. Not\neven at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully\ndistinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of\nthe whalemen as a body. \ue053ere are those this day among them, who, though", "\uf644\uf647\uf64a\n\n\n-----", "intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right\nWhale, would perhaps \u2014either from professional inexperience, or incompetency,\nor timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty\nof whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole\nknowledge of the leviathan is restri\ue076ed to the ignoble monster primitively pursued\nin the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the\npre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly\ncomprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times", "comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times\nthrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists \u2014Olassen and Povelson\u2014declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every other\ncreature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst\nfor human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier\u2019s, were these or almost\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms\nthat at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are \u201cstruck with the\nmost lively terrors\u201d, and \u201coften in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves\nagainst the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death\u201d.

Hence, by inference, it has\nbeen believed by some whalemen, that the nor\u2019 west passage, so long a problem to\nman, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience\nof living men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain\nin Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of\nships floated up to the surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the\nHoly Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully\nequalled by the realities of the whaleman.\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that", "equalled by the realities of the whaleman.\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that\nafter repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot\nbe much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their\nsuperstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted\nin his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be\nmade to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would\nonce more be seen.\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the\nearthly make and incontestable chara\ue076er of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so", "earthly make and incontestable chara\ue076er of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power.

Almost every night they were\nbrought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were\nsubstituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading\na maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of\nthat monomaniac thought of his soul.\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might", "a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of\nthat monomaniac thought of his soul.\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might\nseem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.

But not so in the reality, perhaps. \ue053ough the\ngregarious Sperm Whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in\ngeneral you cannot conclude that the herds which hunted such and such a latitude\nor longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that", "general you cannot conclude that the herds which hunted such and such a latitude\nor longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that\nwere found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true.

So that though Moby Dick had in a former year\nbeen seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,\nor Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the pequod\nto visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would\ninfallibly encounter him there.

For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\nperiodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual\nround, loiters for a predi\ue076ed interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. \ue053ere it was,\ntoo, that most of the deadly encounters with the White Whale had taken place;\nthere the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where\nthe monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.

Because, an interval of three hundred and\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance\nthe White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical\nfeeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the\nBengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.

For the peculiar snow- white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump,\ncould not but be unmistakable.

But as the mind does not exist unless\nleagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\u2019s case, yielding\nup all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its\nown sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of\nself-assumed, independent being of its own.

Some weeks after, the commodore set sail in\nthis impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly\nSperm Whale, that begged a few moments\u2019 confidential business with him. that\nbusiness consisted in fetching the Commodore\u2019s craft\nsuch a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest\nport to heave down and repair.

As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet\nat sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a\nducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all.

But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the\nboys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho\nthat had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most\nathletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one\nof the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business\nnot conne\ue076ed with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades.\nI mention all these particulars so that you may understand exa\ue076ly how this affair\nstood between the two men.\n\u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly", "I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exa\ue076ly how this affair\nstood between the two men.\n\u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly\nmeant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face.

Also, that\nin Henry VIIIth\u2019s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward\nfor inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you\nremember, are a species of whale.

Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of\ncooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they\nlive upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one\nof their most famous do\ue076ors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being\nexceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen,\nwho long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel\u2014that these\nmen a\ue076ually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had\nbeen left ashore after trying out the blubber.

Among the Dutch whalemen these\nscraps are called \u201cfritters;\u201d which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and\ncrisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives\u2019 dough-nuts or olycooks, when fresh. \ue053ey have such an eatable look that the most self-denying\nstranger can hardly keep his hands off.", "\uf645\uf647\uf647\n\n\n-----", "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding\nrichness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good. Look\nat his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo\u2019s (which is esteemed\na rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself,\nhow bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a\ncocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute\nfor butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some\nother substance, and then partaking of it.

Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and\nthe whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing\nout from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules\nand the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions\ndid not make those traditions one whit the less fa\ue076s, for all that.\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\u2019s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\nstory was this:\u2014He had one of those quaint old- fashioned Bibles, embellished\nwith curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah\u2019s whale with two\nspouts in his head \u2014a peculiarity only true with respe\ue076to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the\nfishermen have this saying, \u201cA penny roll would choke him;\u201d his swallow is so very", "fishermen have this saying, \u201cA penny roll would choke him;\u201d his swallow is so very\nsmall. But, to this, Bishop Jebb\u2019s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,\nhints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale\u2019s belly, but as\ntemporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough\nin the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale\u2019s mouth would accommodate a\ncouple of whist tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah\nmight have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the\nRight Whale is toothless.\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want\nof faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to\nhis incarcerated body and the whale\u2019s gastric juices. But this obje\ue076ion likewise\nfalls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have\ntaken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale\u2014even as the French soldiers", "falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have\ntaken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale\u2014even as the French soldiers\nin the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into", "\uf645\uf64c\uf647\n\n\n-----", "them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when\nJonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effe\ue076ed his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I\nwould add, possibly called \u201c\ue053e Whale\u201d, as some craft are nowadays christened the\n\u201cShark,\u201d the \u201cGull,\u201d the \u201cEagle\u201d. Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists\nwho have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant\na life- preserver\u2014an inflated bag of wind\u2014which the endangered prophet swam\nto, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag- Harbor, therefore, seems\nworsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean\nSea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days\u2019 journey\nof Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days\u2019 journey across", "Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days\u2019 journey\nof Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days\u2019 journey across\nfrom the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short\ndistance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the\nCape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length\nof the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such\na supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three\ndays, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow\nfor any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah\u2019s weathering the Cape of\nGood Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great\nheadland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern\nhistory a liar.", "Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great\nheadland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make modern\nhistory a liar.\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish\npride of reason\u2014a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but\nlittle learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only\nshows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the\nreverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah\u2019s going\nto Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification\nof the general miracle. And so it was.

But owing to his marked internal stru\ue076ure which gives\nhim regular lungs, like a human being\u2019s, the whale can only live by inhaling the\ndisengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical\nvisits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth,\nfor, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale\u2019s mouth is buried at least eight feet\nbeneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with\nhis mouth.

No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of\nhis head.\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a fun\ue076ion indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being subsequently brought into conta\ue076with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying\nprinciple, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous\nscientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another", "\uf645\uf64c\uf649\n\n\n-----", "for a considerable time. \ue053at is to say, he would then live without breathing.\nAnomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without\ndrawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for,\nremember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his\nspine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like\nvessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely distended with\noxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,\nhe carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless\ndesert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary\nstomachs. \ue053e anatomical fa\ue076of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me,", "stomachs. \ue053e anatomical fa\ue076of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me,\nwhen I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that Leviathan in having\nhis spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. \ue053is is what I mean. If unmolested,\nupon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of\ntime exa\ue076ly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\nminutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever\nhe rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute.\nNow, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will\nbe always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not\ntill those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term\nbelow.

Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are different; but\nin any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\nspoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?\nHow obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale\u2019s rising exposes him to all\nthe fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast Leviathan\nbe caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much\nthy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the vi\ue076ory to thee!\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on\u2014one breath only serving for two\nor three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking\nor sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.

But owing to the mystery of the spout\u2014whether it be water or whether\nit be vapor\u2014no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is,\nnevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfa\ue076ories. But what does he\nwant of them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.", "\uf645\uf64c\uf64a\n\n\n-----", "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal,\nand as that long canal\u2014like the grand Erie Canal\u2014is furnished with a sort of locks\n(that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion\nof water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that\nwhen he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has\nthe whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything\nto say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the\nconveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the\nupper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much\nlike a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street.

It is certain that the mouth indire\ue076ly communicates with the spouting\ncanal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\nthrough the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to\nbe, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s food\nis far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would.

For even when tranquilly\nswimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried\nas a dromedary\u2019s in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of\nwater on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock\nfilled up with rain.\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise", "\uf645\uf64c\uf64b\n\n\n-----", "nature of the whale spout.

Nevertheless,\nit cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon\npoint.\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings.\nLike fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety.

It is therefore not\nin stri\ue076chara\ue076er, however admirably satirical, that after going to school himself,\nhe should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.\nHis title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed\nupon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled\nthis sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed", "\uf646\uf644\uf648\n\n\n-----", "himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his\nyounger days, and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into\nsome of his pupils.\n\ue053e same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes\nhimself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales.

For at that time, and\nindeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained,\nlike amber itself, a problem to the learned. \ue053ough the word ambergris is but the\nFrench compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distin\ue076. For\namber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland\nsoils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a\nhard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth- pieces to pipes, for\nbeads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,\nthat it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\npomatum. \ue053e Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same", "that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\npomatum. \ue053e Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same\npurpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter\u2019s in Rome. Some wine merchants\ndrop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\nthemselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet so\nit is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by others the effe\ue076, of\nthe dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless\nby administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth\u2019s pills, and then running\nout of harm\u2019s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain hard,\nround, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors\u2019 trousers buttons;\nbut it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid", "round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors\u2019 trousers buttons;\nbut it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid\nbones embalmed in that manner.\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found\nin the heart of such decay; is this nothing?

It was a colle\ue076ion of furnaces,\nfat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave\nforth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite different from a South Sea Sperm\nWhaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold\nwith oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and\nin the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. \ue053e truth is, that living or", "with oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and\nin the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. \ue053e truth is, that living or\ndead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill\nodor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affe\ue076ed\nto dete\ue076a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly\nbe otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health;\ntaking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\nopen air.

And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales,\nin the very beginning of his work (page \uf646), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.

And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman\n(more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
